# Background and aims:
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exerts pleiotropic effects on inflammation, cancer and maintenance of mucosal homeostasis. To test its role in colorectal cancer, we genetically inactivated its rate-limiting synthesis in two mouse lines. An unexpected phenotype consisting of spontaneous mucosal ulceration was found exclusively in the colons of strain A mice, providing a new model for studying human sensitivity to pharmacologic disruption of the PGE2 pathway.
 
# Methods:
Mucosal ulcerations were examined in Ptges-deficient mice on strain A (A/D:KO) and C57BL/6 (B6D:KO).  RNA sequencing of colons identified inflammatory signatures in sensitive A/D:KO mice. Microbial dysbiosis was evaluated in the fecal stream using 16S rRNA sequencing.  
 
# Results:
Progressive colonic ulcerations developed spontaneously in A/D:KO mice, a phenotype that was absent in B6D:KO mice.  RNAseq revealed robust expression of pro-inflammatory genes in A/D:KO mice, including chemokines (Cxcl, Cxcr) and calprotectins, changes that occur before the appearance of overt pathology.  In resistant B6D:KO colons, there was potent enrichment in genes involved in protection against tissue injury, including tripartite motif genes (Trim) and apolipoproteins (Apol).  A/D:KO colons show increased expression in levels of several key antibacterial peptides (a-defensins), predictive of altered gut microbial community structure.  Alterations to several microbial species include Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides vulgatus, likely associated with dysregulation of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis. 
 
# Conclusion:
These results suggest that absence of Ptges causes a dramatic shift in the inflammatory milieu in strain A mice, an effect that may result from unremitting bacterial infections, triggered in part by dysregulation of epithelial homeostasis and a subtle defect in intrinsic immune regulation.
